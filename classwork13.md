### Plotting

#### Code from class

```
# create a histogram for fare
sns.displot(data = taxis, x = "fare")
plt.show()

# create a bar plot for pickup_borough
sns.displot(data = taxis, x = "pickup_borough")
plt.show()
```

#### Exercises
1. **(CW) Create a histogram for each quantitative variable in the penguins dataset**
1. **(CW) Create a bar chart for each categorical variable in the penguins dataset**
1. Create a histogram of `bill_length_mm` of Adelie penguins.
1. There are many different kinds of plots you can make with the `displot()` function. What happens when you use an x and y variable? 
1. Test out other displot options based on this document: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/distributions.html 

## Part 2


### Exercises 

1. **(CW) Download the college majors dataset and load it using pandas: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WK9sQdr_S7RHDUIdEBPZ88dPeOUvTY7E/view?usp=sharing (you can find documentation about this dataset here: https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/college-majors/workspace/file?filename=readme.md
)**
1. Find the number of rows and columns of the DataFrame.
1. **(CW) What is the data type of each column?**

1. **(CW) Make a plot of a quantitative variable using `displot()`. Set `hue` equal to a categorical variable. Try with `kind = "hist"` and `kind = "kde"`. Which provides a better representation of your data?**
1. **(CW) Make a plot of a categorical variable vs a quantitative variable using `catplot()`. Set `hue` equal to a categorical variable. Try with `kind` equal to each of the following: `"strip", "swarm", "box", "violin", "boxen", "point", "bar"`. Which provides the best representation of your data?**
1. **(CW) Create at least one of the plots you brainstormed in last classwork (Brainstorm at least three plots that would help you understand this data).**
1. Work on improving one of your plots so that it enhances understanding of the dataset. Save it by including `plt.savefig("my_img.png")` on the line before `plt.show()`.

### Exercises 

Use the "college majors" dataset from Classwork 16 for this section.

1. **(CW) Create a plot of with a regression line between two quantitative variables you just identified. Does it look like the two variables have a linear relationship?**
1. **(CW) Create a `jointplot` between these two variables. Color by a categorical variable. What extra information does the jointplot provide?**
1. Explore different jointplot "kinds" : `"scatter", "kde", "hist", "reg"`. Which kind is most appropriate for your data?

## Part 4

### Code from class

```
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Stops columns from being cut off when displayed
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)

books.sort_values("Rating")
books.sort_values(["Rating", "PublishYear"])
books.sort_values(["Rating", "PublishYear"], ascending = False)
```

### Exercises

1. **(CW) What is the title of the book with the greatest number of pages?**
1. What is the title of the book with the greatest number of ratings?
1. What is the title of the book with the greatest number of reviews?
1. **(CW) Sort the data by “PublishYear”, “PublishDay”, and “RatingDistTotal” in descending order.**


## Part 5

### Code from class

```
# log-scale axis
sns.relplot(data = books, x = "RatingDistTotal", y = "CountsOfReview")
plt.xscale("log")
plt.yscale("log")
plt.show()

# filter quantitative
books = books[(books["PublishDay"] > 10) & (books["PublishDay"] < 20)]

# filter categorical
books = books[(books["Publisher"] == "HarperCollins") | (books["Publisher"] == "Penguin Books") | (books["Publisher"] == "Simon  Schuster")]
books = books[books["Publisher"].isin(["Harper Collins", "Penguin Books", "Simon  Schuster"])]
```

### Exercises

1. **(CW) Filter your dataframe to remove outliers from the “PublishYear” variable, and save the dataframe.**
1. **(CW) Filter your dataframe based on the “Language” variable: Choose only three languages to include.**
1. Filter books to only rows for which “pagesNumber” is greater than 0 and less than 20,000 and save as `books`.
1. Are there other columns it would make sense to filter on to clean up the data? Perform more filtering as you see fit.
1. **(CW)) Create a scatterplot with at least one of the axes log-scaled.**

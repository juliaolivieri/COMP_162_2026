## Part 3

Example code from class:

```
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a histogram of the "total_bill" variable
sns.displot(data=tips, x="total_bill")
plt.show()

# Create a histogram of the "total_bill" variable colored by "smoker" and faceted by "time"
sns.displot(data=tips, x="total_bill",hue = "smoker", col="time", kind = "hist")
plt.show()

sns.displot(data=tips, x = "tip", hue="time", kind="kde")
plt.show()

# Create a scatterplot of "total_bill" vs "tip"
sns.relplot(
    data=tips,
    x="total_bill", y="tip"
)
plt.show()

# Create a scatterplot of "total_bill" vs "tip" colored by "smoker", faceted by "time", with marker style determined by "smoker" and size of the marker determined by "size"
sns.relplot(
    data=tips,
    x="total_bill", y="tip", col="time",
    hue="smoker", style="smoker", size="size"
)
plt.show()

sns.relplot(
    data=penguins,
    x="bill_length_mm", y="bill_depth_mm", col="sex",
    hue="species", style="island", size="body_mass_g"
)
plt.show()

# Create a barplot of "day" by "total_bill" colored by "smoker"
sns.catplot(data=tips, kind="bar", x="day", y="total_bill", hue="smoker")
plt.show()

sns.catplot(data = penguins, x = "species", y = "body_mass_g", kind = "box", hue="sex")
plt.show()
```

### Exercises 

Use the "college majors" dataset from Classwork 16 for this section.

1. **(CW) Create a scatterplot with two quantitative variables. Color the points by another variable. Include your interpretation of the plot.**
1. **(CW) Create a plot of with a regression line between two quantitative variables. Does it look like the two variables have a linear relationship?**
1. **(CW) Create a `jointplot` between these two variables. Color by a categorical variable. What extra information does the jointplot provide?**
1. Explore different jointplot "kinds" : `"scatter", "kde", "hist", "reg"`. Which kind is most appropriate for your data?



## Part 3
The goodreads data set can be downloaded at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h8mKao45AnBW5FZkx4b34Lo2jwGjBasH/view?usp=sharing 

Each row corresponds to one book. Column definitions are the following:

Variable | Description
--|--
`Name` | The title of the book
`RatingDist1` | The number of 1-star ratings
`RatingDist2` | The number of 2-star ratings
`RatingDist3` | The number of 3-star ratings
`RatingDist4` | The number of 4-star ratings
`RatingDist5` | The number of 5-star ratings
`RatingDistTotal` | The total number of ratings
`pagesNumber` | The number of pages in the book
`PublishDay` | The day of the month the book was published
`PublishMonth` | The month the book was published (1-12)
`Publisher` | The publisher of the book
`CountsOfReview` | The number of reviews the book has received (different from ratings)
`PublishYear` | The year the book was published
`Language` | The language the book is written in
`Authors` | The author(s) of the book
`Rating` | The average rating given to this book (out of 5)

**(CW) Brainstorm questions to guide your exploratory analysis of this data.**

What might lead to an interesting discovery?
What are you curious about given the dataset columns we have access to?

## Part 4

### Code from class

```
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Stops columns from being cut off when displayed
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)

books.sort_values("Rating")
books.sort_values(["Rating", "PublishYear"])
books.sort_values(["Rating", "PublishYear"], ascending = False)
```

### Exercises

1. **(CW) What is the title of the book with the greatest number of pages?**
1. What is the title of the book with the greatest number of ratings?
1. What is the title of the book with the greatest number of reviews?
1. **(CW) Sort the data by “PublishYear”, “PublishDay”, and “RatingDistTotal” in descending order.**


## Part 5

### Code from class

```
# log-scale axis
sns.relplot(data = books, x = "RatingDistTotal", y = "CountsOfReview")
plt.xscale("log")
plt.yscale("log")
plt.show()

# filter quantitative
books = books[(books["PublishDay"] > 10) & (books["PublishDay"] < 20)]

# filter categorical
books = books[(books["Publisher"] == "HarperCollins") | (books["Publisher"] == "Penguin Books") | (books["Publisher"] == "Simon  Schuster")]
books = books[books["Publisher"].isin(["Harper Collins", "Penguin Books", "Simon  Schuster"])]
```

### Exercises

1. **(CW) Filter your dataframe to remove outliers from the “PublishYear” variable, and save the dataframe.**
1. **(CW) Filter your dataframe based on the “Language” variable: Choose only three languages to include.**
1. Filter books to only rows for which “pagesNumber” is greater than 0 and less than 20,000 and save as `books`.
1. Are there other columns it would make sense to filter on to clean up the data? Perform more filtering as you see fit.
1. **(CW)) Create a scatterplot with at least one of the axes log-scaled.**

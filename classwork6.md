# Classwork 6: Data Visualization with ggplot2


## Part 1: Making your first plot

### Code from class

```
# install the tidyverse package if you haven't already
install.packages("tidyverse")

# load in the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# make a scatterplot of displ vs hwy
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

# make the same scatterplot of displ vs hwy
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

ggsave("my_first_plot.png")
```

### Exercises
1. **(CW) Open a new R script file. This is what you will turn in for today's classwork.**
1. **(CW) If you haven't already, install the "tidyverse" library using `install.packages("tidyverse")**
1. **(CW) Load the "tidyverse" library.**
1. View the dataset mpg with `View(mpg)` (this dataset is pre-loaded with the tidyverse package).
1. **(Classwork) Use the code above to create a plot of `displ` vs `hwy`.**
1. **(Classwork) Save this plot using `ggsave()` (example command above). You may want to set your working directory to a convenient place for the plot to be output.**
1. **(Classwork) Make a scatterplot of `hwy` versus `cyl`.**
1. **(Classwork) What can you conclude from this scatterplot?**
1. Run `ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))`. What do you see?
1. Try switching `hwy` and `displ` between the two axes.
1. Try using the following commands from last lecture on this data: `head(mpg)`, `head()`, `summary()`, `str()`. 
1. How many rows does `mpg` have? How many columns?
1. What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.
1. What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` versus `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?
1. Try making scatterplots for other combinations of quantitative variables. What can you learn about the data?
 
## Part 2: Changing plot aesthetics

### Code from class
```
# color points in the scatterplot by class
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point() 

# using multiple aesthetics
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, 
                 hwy, 
                 color = class, 
                 shape = drv, 
                 size = cyl,
                 alpha = year)) +
  geom_point()

```

### Exercises
1. **(CW) Plot `cty` vs `hwy` and color by `drv`, determine shape by `fl`, and size by `displ`.**
1. **(CW) Make three different plots of `cty` vs `hwy`, the first colored by `drv`, the second with shape determined by `fl`, and the third with size determined by `displ`.**
1. Is it easier to see patterns in the plot from 1. or the plot from 2.?
1. Plot `displ` vs `cty`. Try mapping color to `hwy`. What happens?+
1. Try mapping a quantitative variable to shape. What happens?+
1. Try mapping a categorical variable to size. What happens?+
1. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?+
1. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `aes(color = displ < 5)`?+
1. (Challenge) You should have access to the `diamonds` dataset (it is pre-loaded with the `ggplot2` package). Try plotting different variables against each other. Which aesthetic choices let you tell the best story? You can see what the variables mean using `?diamonds`. 


## Part 3: Faceting

### Code from class
```
# plot displ vs hwy, colored and faceted by class
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~class)
```

### Exercises
1. **(CW) Plot `displ` vs `hwy` and facet by `cyl`.**
1. **(CW) What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?**
1. Try faceting by each variable other than `displ` and `hwy`. Which seem the most useful? Which seem the least useful?
1. What happens when you color by the same variable that you're faceting by?+
1. What happens when you color by a different variable?+
1. (Challenge) Try faceting in the `diamond` dataset as well. When do you think faceting is preferable to using aesthetics to distinguish groups?

## Part 4: Exploring geoms

### Code from class
```
# create a histogram from a quantitative variable
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Create a histogram of the hwy variable with a bin width of 5
ggplot(mpg,
       aes(hwy)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=5)

# create a bar chart from a categorical variable
ggplot(mpg, aes(fl)) +
  geom_bar()

# create "smooth" line from two quantitative variables
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

### Exercises
1. **(CW) Create a histogram of the `cty` variable.** 
1. **(CW) Create a bar plot of the `class` variable.**
1. Explore the distribution of the `carat` variable in the diamonds dataset using a histogram (`diamonds` is pre-loaded). What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?
1. Try making either a histogram or bar plot for each variable in mpg, depending on whether it's quantitative or categorical.
1. (Challenge) What happens when you use color in these plots?+
1. (Challenge) Scroll through this list of the "top 50 ggplot2 visualizations": http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html. Copy and paste the code for one that is of interest to you. Can you make a version of that plot using the `mpg` data?
